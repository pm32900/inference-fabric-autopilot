// Package recommender turns telemetry into explained diagnoses.
//
// The design goal is that every output can be checked by the person reading it.
// A finding names the rule that produced it, the numbers that triggered it, and
// the thresholds they were compared against, so an operator can disagree with
// the conclusion without having to read the source.
//
// Three properties distinguish this from a set of Prometheus alerting rules,
// which is the obvious alternative and a perfectly good one:
//
//   - Rules combine signals. "Queue is deep" is not actionable; "queue is deep
//     while the GPU is idle" and "queue is deep while the GPU is saturated"
//     have opposite fixes, and the engine says which one it is.
//   - Rules require conditions to persist. A single scrape showing a deep queue
//     is normal scheduler behaviour.
//   - Rules refuse to fire on absent data. A runtime that does not export GPU
//     utilisation produces no GPU findings rather than findings about zero.
//
// Rules never mutate anything. The output is advice for a human.
