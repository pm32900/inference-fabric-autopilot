// Package alerting delivers recommendations to an HTTP endpoint.
//
// Two properties shape the whole package.
//
// The rule engine is stateless: it re-derives every finding from the current
// telemetry each time it runs. A finding that holds for an hour is therefore
// produced by every evaluation for that hour, and a sender that posted whatever
// it was handed would deliver the same alert every collection interval. The
// deduplication state here is what turns a stream of repeated evaluations into
// transitions. See docs/adr/0006-alert-deduplication.md.
//
// Delivery is off the collector's path entirely. A webhook endpoint is a third
// party that IFA does not control, and a diagnostics tool that stops collecting
// telemetry because Slack is slow has failed at its actual job. Alerts go onto a
// bounded queue and are sent by one goroutine, following the same
// bounded-queue-and-single-writer shape as internal/storage/timescale.
