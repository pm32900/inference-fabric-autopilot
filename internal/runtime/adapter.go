// payload to a partially-filled snapshot: they know metric names, units and
// version quirks, and nothing about scheduling, HTTP, or state. Everything that
// needs memory across scrapes — counter-to-rate conversion, counter-reset
// handling, staleness — lives in the collector, so adapters stay trivially
// testable against a fixture and a new runtime can be added without touching
// the collection loop.
